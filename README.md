# PyPong
A simple and fun Pong game written in Python using the Pygame library.

# Game Description
Pong is one of the earliest video games, released in 1972. It's a virtual table game simulating a table tennis match. Players control paddles that move vertically on the screen and must bounce a ball to prevent it from passing their side of the screen. This project recreates the classic Pong experience using Python and Pygame.

# Installation Instructions
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official Python website.
If you haven't already, install Pygame.

# Game Instructions
Use the up and down arrow keys to move player 2's paddle.
For player 1, use the S and X keys to move the paddle up and down.
The goal is to bounce the ball with your paddle and prevent it from passing your side of the screen.
The player who misses the ball gives a point to their opponent. The first player to reach a certain number of points wins the game.
