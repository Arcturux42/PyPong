# PyPong
A simple and fun Pong game written in Python using the Pygame library.

# Game Description
Pong is one of the earliest video games, released in 1972. It's a virtual table game simulating a table tennis match. Players control paddles that move vertically on the screen and must bounce a ball to prevent it from passing their side of the screen. This project recreates the classic Pong experience using Python and Pygame.

# Installation Instructions
